        <div class="info">
        <p><strong>Below:</strong> Some considerations that went into the design of the Coronavirus nation picker.  The nation picker allowed users in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to show only rules and guidance relevant to them, so they wouldn't be confused by rules meant for other nations.</p><p>
      In the end, we decided to display all the nations on the top level rather than hide options under a button or link, to avoid someone missing the link and seeing information meant for another nation.</p>
